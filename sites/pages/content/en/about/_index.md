## What's next for Notations?

Notations is an open source project and we love getting patches and contributions to make it even better.  More and more features will be added to Notations to make it easy for Carnatic music lovers, students and teachers to enjoy, learn and teach Carnatic music on the web. 

Visit our [Issues](https://github.com/panyam/notations/issues) to see what we're currently working on. If there's something you'd like to see in Notations, please create an issue yourself - or assign yourself an issue if you'd like to fix or add something! See our [contribution guidelines](/docs/contribution-guidelines/) for more information.
